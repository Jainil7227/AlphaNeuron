Problem statment 
Problem:

Road logistics is still planned as isolated trips rather than as a continuous operation across a vehicle's day or an operator's fleet. Load matching, routing, and pricing are decided upfront, with little ability to adapt once a truck is already on the road. As conditions change-traffic, fuel costs, delivery delays, or new load availability- trucks often run underutilized or return empty.

User Reality:

Truck drivers face idle time, uncertain income, and empty return journeys. Fleet operators managing multiple trucks struggle to coordinate vehicles that are in different locations, at different stages of a trip, and under different constraints.

Expectation:

Design an agentic system that continuously observes, decides, and acts on logistics operations as an adaptive process. The system should:

- Reason about future outcomes while vehicles are already in motion

Balance profitability, time, capacity utilization, and operational

constraints

- Support decision-making for both individual drivers and multi- truck operators
