🚀 **Excited to share our winning solution: Neuro-Logistics! 🚛✨**

We had an incredible experience participating in **Hekeron**, the flagship hackathon at **Tekron 2.0**, organized by **Newton School of Technology**! 🎓💻

Over the last 24 hours, my team and I built **Neuro-Logistics** – an AI-powered logistics platform designed to transform road freight from a static process into a fluid, intelligent operation.

🌐 **The Problem:**
Traditional logistics suffers from rigid routing, empty return trucks (deadhead), and underutilized capacity. Drivers often face unexpected delays without real-time support.

💡 **Our Solution:**
We built a comprehensive driver dashboard and backend system featuring 3 core AI modules:

1.  **Context-Aware Mission Planner** 🗺️
    *   Dynamic pricing engine based on effort (not just distance).
    *   Infrastructure-aware routing (toll costs, checkpost delays).

2.  **Rolling Decision Engine** 🧠
    *   Real-time "Copilot" that monitors traffic and weather.
    *   Autonomous rerouting when conditions change.
    *   Calculates "Opportunity vs. Cost" for detours.

3.  **Dynamic Capacity Manager** 📦
    *   Finds LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) matches en-route to fill empty space.
    *   Predictive backhauling to ensure no truck returns empty.

🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet Maps
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
*   **AI:** Gemini AI (for the intelligent Copilot & Decision Engine)

It was amazing to see our AI Copilot act like a real companion for drivers, helping them maximize earnings and stay safe!
